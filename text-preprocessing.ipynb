Tokenization**\n    \n• What it is: The fundamental process of breaking down raw text into smaller, meaningful units called \"tokens\". These tokens can be words, sentences, or even subword units.\n\n• Why it's important: It's a crucial precursor to feature engineering. Incorrect tokenization can confuse the model and lead to poor results, especially when trying to extract unique words or other features.\n\n• Types:\n    ◦ Word Tokenization: Breaking text into individual words.\n    ◦ Sentence Tokenization: Breaking a paragraph into individual sentences.\n    \n• Challenges: Tokenization isn't always straightforward due to prefixes, suffixes, infixes, special characters (e.g., \"20$\" should be \"20\" and \"$\"), contractions (e.g., \"I'm\"), and proper nouns (e.g., \"New York\").\n\n\n• Techniques:\n\n    ◦ Python's split() function: Simple, works on spaces, but fails in complex scenarios (e.g., \"Delhi!\" splits as \"Delhi!\" not \"Delhi\" and \"!\").\n    \n    ◦ Regular Expressions: More sophisticated than split(), allows defining patterns for splitting, offering better control but can still be complex to handle all edge cases.\n    \n    ◦ Libraries (NLTK & spaCy): These are the recommended approach.\n        ▪ NLTK: Provides word_tokenize and sent_tokenize functions with internal algorithms to handle many complexities. However, it can still struggle with certain cases like email IDs being split or incorrect handling of numbers.\n        ▪ spaCy: Often provides the best tokenization results in observed cases, handling many difficult scenarios more effectively than NLTK (e.g., email IDs, numbers like \"5km\").","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# word tokenization\nsent1 = 'I am going to delhi'\nsent1.split()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-07-31T05:47:53.005565Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-07-31T05:47:53.005927Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-07-31T05:47:53.012281Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-07-31T05:47:53.005891Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-07-31T05:47:53.011274Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[{"execution_count":39,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"['I', 'am', 'going', 'to', 'delhi']"},"metadata":{}}],"execution_count":39},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# sentence tokenization\nsent2 = 'I am going to delhi.

Stemming and Lemmatization**\n\nThese two techniques aim to reduce inflected words to their root forms.\n\n• Inflexion: A grammatical modification of a word to express different categories like tense, case, voice, etc. (e.g., \"walk,\" \"walking,\" \"walked,\" \"walks\" are inflections of \"work\").\n\n• Stemming:\n    ◦ What it is: The process of reducing inflected words to their \"root\" or \"stem\" form by removing suffixes or prefixes. The stem itself might not be a valid word in the language (e.g., \"probably\" stems to \"probabl\").\n    \n    ◦ Why it's used: Most useful in Information Retrieval Systems (like search engines) where searching for \"fish,\" \"fishing,\" or \"fished\" should all return relevant results related to \"fish\".\n    \n    ◦ How it's done: Using algorithms called \"stemmers\" (e.g., NLTK's Porter Stemmer for English, Snowball Stemmer for other languages).\n    \n    ◦ Caveat: Since the output might not be a real word, it's generally not suitable if the output needs to be displayed to users. It is, however, faster than lemmatization.\n\n\n    \n**• Lemmatization:**\n\n    ◦ What it is: Similar to stemming, it reduces inflected words to their root form, but the crucial difference is that the output (called a \"lemma\") is always a valid word in the language (e.g., \"better\" lemmas to \"good\").\n    \n    ◦ How it differs from Stemming: Lemmatization is typically slower than stemming because it relies on a lexical dictionary (like WordNet in NLTK) to find the correct base form, whereas stemming uses algorithmic rules.\n    \n    ◦ Why it's used: Preferred when the output needs to be interpretable or displayed to users, or when linguistic accuracy is more important than speed.\n    \n    ◦ How it's done: Using tools like NLTK's WordNet Lemmatizer. It's important to specify the Part of Speech (POS) of the word for accurate lemmatization (e.g., whether \"run\" is a verb or a noun).","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from nltk.stem.porter import PorterStemmer","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-07-31T05:52:43.047761Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-07-31T05:52:43.048103Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-07-31T05:52:43.053183Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-07-31T05:52:43.048064Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-07-31T05:52:43.052015Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":54},{"cell_type":"code","source":"ps = PorterStemmer()\ndef stem_words(text):\n    return \" \".join([ps.stem(word) for word in text.split()])","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-07-31T05:52:44.299661Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-07-31T05:52:44.299976Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-07-31T05:52:44.305437Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-07-31T05:52:44.299944Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-07-31T05:52:44.304193Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":55},{"cell_type":"code","source":"sample = \"walk walks walking walked\"\nstem_words(sample)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-07-31T05:52:47.392072Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-07-31T05:52:47.392442Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-07-31T05:52:47.400034Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-07-31T05:52:47.392398Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-07-31T05:52:47.398783Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[{"execution_count":56,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"'walk walk walk walk'"},"metadata":{}}],"execution_count":56},{"cell_type":"code","source":"text = 'probably my alltime favorite movie a story of selflessness sacrifice and dedication to a noble cause but its not preachy or boring it just never gets old despite my having seen it some 15 or more times in the last 25 years paul lukas performance brings tears to my eyes and bette davis in one of her very few truly sympathetic roles is a delight the kids are as grandma says more like dressedup midgets than children but that only makes them more fun to watch and the mothers slow awakening to whats happening in the world and under her own roof is believable and startling if i had a dozen thumbs theyd all be up for this movie'\nprint(text)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-07-31T05:52:50.045747Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-07-31T05:52:50.046108Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-07-31T05:52:50.051935Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-07-31T05:52:50.046072Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-07-31T05:52:50.050744Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"probably my alltime favorite movie a story of selflessness sacrifice and dedication to a noble cause but its not preachy or boring it just never gets old despite my having seen it some 15 or more times in the last 25 years paul lukas performance brings tears to my eyes and bette davis in one of her very few truly sympathetic roles is a delight the kids are as grandma says more like dressedup midgets than children but that only makes them more fun to watch and the mothers slow awakening to whats happening in the world and under her own roof is believable and startling if i had a dozen thumbs theyd all be up for this movie\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":57},{"cell_type":"code","source":"stem_words(text)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-07-31T05:52:53.263083Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-07-31T05:52:53.263392Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-07-31T05:52:53.273037Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-07-31T05:52:53.263360Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-07-31T05:52:53.271892Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[{"execution_count":58,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"'probabl my alltim favorit movi a stori of selfless sacrific and dedic to a nobl caus but it not preachi or bore it just never get old despit my have seen it some 15 or more time in the last 25 year paul luka perform bring tear to my eye and bett davi in one of her veri few truli sympathet role is a delight the kid are as grandma say more like dressedup midget than children but that onli make them more fun to watch and the mother slow awaken to what happen in the world and under her own roof is believ and startl if i had a dozen thumb theyd all be up for thi movi'"},"metadata":{}}],"execution_count":58},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import nltk\nfrom nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer\nwordnet_lemmatizer = WordNetLemmatizer()\n\nsentence = \"He was running and eating at same time.
