    "    ◦ To prevent them from being treated as separate words: When tokenizing, punctuations might become individual tokens, unnecessarily increasing document size and confusing the model.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ◦ To prevent them from being part of words: Sometimes, punctuation attached to a word can make the system treat it as a unique word (e.g., \"Hello!\" vs. \"Hello\"), which also confuses the model.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ◦ While usually beneficial, in very rare cases, punctuations might be needed.\n",

    "    \n",

    "    ◦ A simple looping approach can be used, but it's very slow for large datasets.\n",

    "**9. Tokenization**\n",
    "    \n",
    "• What it is: The fundamental process of breaking down raw text into smaller, meaningful units called \"tokens\". These tokens can be words, sentences, or even subword units.\n",
    "\n",
    "• Why it's important: It's a crucial precursor to feature engineering. Incorrect tokenization can confuse the model and lead to poor results, especially when trying to extract unique words or other features.\n",
    "\n",
    "• Types:\n",
    "    ◦ Word Tokenization: Breaking text into individual words.\n",
    "    ◦ Sentence Tokenization: Breaking a paragraph into individual sentences.\n",
    "    \n",
    "• Challenges: Tokenization isn't always straightforward due to prefixes, suffixes, infixes, special characters (e.g., \"20$\" should be \"20\" and \"$\"), contractions (e.g., \"I'm\"), and proper nouns (e.g., \"New York\").\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "• Techniques:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ◦ Python's split() function: Simple, works on spaces, but fails in complex scenarios (e.g., \"Delhi!\" splits as \"Delhi!\" not \"Delhi\" and \"!\").\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ◦ Regular Expressions: More sophisticated than split(), allows defining patterns for splitting, offering better control but can still be complex to handle all edge cases.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ◦ Libraries (NLTK & spaCy): These are the recommended approach.\n",
    "        ▪ NLTK: Provides word_tokenize and sent_tokenize functions with internal algorithms to handle many complexities. However, it can still struggle with certain cases like email IDs being split or incorrect handling of numbers.\n",
    "        ▪ spaCy: Often provides the best tokenization results in observed cases, handling many difficult scenarios more effectively than NLTK (e.g., email IDs, numbers like \"5km\")."

    "**10. Stemming and Lemmatization**\n",
    "\n",
    "These two techniques aim to reduce inflected words to their root forms.\n",
    "\n",
    "• Inflexion: A grammatical modification of a word to express different categories like tense, case, voice, etc. (e.g., \"walk,\" \"walking,\" \"walked,\" \"walks\" are inflections of \"work\").\n",
    "\n",
    "• Stemming:\n",
    "    ◦ What it is: The process of reducing inflected words to their \"root\" or \"stem\" form by removing suffixes or prefixes. The stem itself might not be a valid word in the language (e.g., \"probably\" stems to \"probabl\").\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ◦ Why it's used: Most useful in Information Retrieval Systems (like search engines) where searching for \"fish,\" \"fishing,\" or \"fished\" should all return relevant results related to \"fish\".\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ◦ How it's done: Using algorithms called \"stemmers\" (e.g., NLTK's Porter Stemmer for English, Snowball Stemmer for other languages).\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ◦ Caveat: Since the output might not be a real word, it's generally not suitable if the output needs to be displayed to users. It is, however, faster than lemmatization.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "**• Lemmatization:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    ◦ What it is: Similar to stemming, it reduces inflected words to their root form, but the crucial difference is that the output (called a \"lemma\") is always a valid word in the language (e.g., \"better\" lemmas to \"good\").\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ◦ How it differs from Stemming: Lemmatization is typically slower than stemming because it relies on a lexical dictionary (like WordNet in NLTK) to find the correct base form, whereas stemming uses algorithmic rules.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ◦ Why it's used: Preferred when the output needs to be interpretable or displayed to users, or when linguistic accuracy is more important than speed.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ◦ How it's done: Using tools like NLTK's WordNet Lemmatizer. It's important to specify the Part of Speech (POS) of the word for accurate lemmatization (e.g., whether \"run\" is a verb or a noun)."
